      The GTX 1660 Super has a launch price of just $230 USD with<br>
      comparable performance to the $280 USD 1660 Ti. The 1660 Super has<br>
      14 Gbps GDDR6 (versus 12Gbps GDDR6 for the 1660 Ti and 8Gbps<br>
      GDDR5 for the 1660). The 1660 range of cards sits in the sweet spot for<br>
      many gamers because they offer superb 1080p EFps in popular titles<br>
      and they are relatively hassle-free in terms of noise, compatibility, and<br>
      stability. The 1660S also features Turing NVENC which is far more<br>
      efficient than CPU encoding and alleviates the need for casual<br>
      streamers to use a dedicated stream PC. Shop prices will determine<br>
      which 1660 series card represents the best value over time but at<br>
      today's prices, the 1660 Super effectively undercuts the 1660 Ti by $50<br>
      USD thus challenging the RX 590 in terms of overall value at 1080p. The<br>
      next step up from the 1660S would be to the $325 RTX 2060.<br>
