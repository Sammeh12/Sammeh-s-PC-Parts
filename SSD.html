      The 970 Evo Plus offers excellent sustained write performance both in<br>
      and out of cache. This results in consistent performance even when the<br>
      drive is nearly full. Samsung also have a great track record for reliability,<br>
      this drive will likely last a lifetime. The larger capacity drives (1TB+) offer<br>
      even better write performance and may be more appropriate for some<br>
      users. We use this drive (and its larger siblings) extensively in our EFps<br>
      Lab at UserBenchmark.<br>
