      The 1TB Seagate Barracuda 2016 (ST1000DM010) has an impressive<br>
      performance profile. With Sequential read/writes averaging 173 and 159<br>
      MBps respectively, the Barracuda can make short work of even<br>
      moderately large backups. The small file (4K) performance profile is<br>
      less impressive but still adequate with average read/writes coming in at<br>
      0.87 and 1.53 MBps respectively. For use as OS drives, rotational disks<br>
      are quickly loosing market share to SSDs which offer orders of<br>
      magnitude faster 4k read/write speeds. On the other hand cheap TLC<br>
      based SSDs often have slower sustained write speeds than their<br>
      rotational counterparts. Reasonably good overall performance can be<br>
      achieved by using a TLC SSD to host the OS and a larger rotational<br>
      drive such as the Barracuda for backups and media files. Larger<br>
      capacity variants of this drive offer both better performance and better<br>
      value for money.<br>
