      Fractal Design's Meshify 2 Compact offers an excellent foundation for<br>
      simple ATX gaming systems, and a chassis that will stand the test of<br>
      time well. It doesn't go out of its way to be eccentric, rather providing<br>
      the user with a classy chassis that will look good for a long time to<br>
      come -- a chassis you can grow up with. And while its materials quality<br>
      could be seen as a little lacking, this is a case where you pay for its<br>
      excellent design, not only in looks, but also practicality: it has tons of<br>
      cable management space, is laid out logically and with easy to access<br>
      filters, a breeze to use and maintain as your daily driver. The biggest<br>
      catch to this case is its slightly steep price and lack of RGB, but we<br>
      believe it's worth paying just for how well thought-out its practical<br>
      design is.<br>
