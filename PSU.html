      Of the two variants of Corsair's CX450, the Great Wall version is more<br>
      efficient than CWT's, especially under light loads, and has a more<br>
      efficient 5VSB rail. On the other side, it has a more-aggressive fan profile,<br>
      so its noise output is increased. In the US market, you will only find the<br>
      CWT version, which is made in Vietnam instead of China, so it avoids the<br>
      tariffs and keeps its price tag low.<br>
