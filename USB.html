      The new Adata Dashdrive UV128 has a performance profile that closely<br>
      matches its older, and recently rebranded, Dashdrive Elite S102 Pro<br>
      sibling. Comparing the two shows that the drives are nearly identical<br>
      except for form factor. Personally I prefer a retractable form factor as<br>
      USB caps are easily lost. Overall in terms of performance the Dashdrive<br>
      UV128 is slightly above average and in terms of value for money it is also<br>
      reasonable.<br>
