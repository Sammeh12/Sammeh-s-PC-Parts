      Intelâ€™s latest 10-core i5-12600K Alder Lake desktop processor offers an<br>
      impressive 50% 64-core performance improvement over its<br>
      predecessor. The 12600K combines six hyper-threaded Golden Cove<br>
      P-cores with clock speeds up to 4.9 GHz and four energy efficient<br>
      Gracemont E-cores for a total of 16 threads. Alder Lake CPUs have a<br>
      new LGA 1700 socket which requires new cooler brackets and a new<br>
      Z690 motherboard. Z690 brings several new features including PCIe 5.0<br>
      and DDR5 memory. Most Z690 boards will ship in both DDR4 and DDR5<br>
      variants. DDR4 is likely the better option, at least until DDR5 prices<br>
      settle. With an MRSP of just $290 USD, the 12600K is both cheaper and<br>
      faster than the competition in both single and, notably, multi-core<br>
      performance. As a result, even AMD's prolific marketing infrastructure<br>
      (youtube, reddit, forums etc.) will struggle to drive sales, at least until<br>
      Zen 4 launches (est. late 2022). In the meantime, Intel's i5-12600K is<br>
      the obvious choice for consumers that do not wish to pay over the odds<br>
      for almost unparalleled performance in the majority of workloads<br>
      including gaming. That said, gamers that already own a K series CPU<br>
      from the 8th gen. or higher will see limited gains in the majority of titles<br>
      when paired with a 3060 (or lower) tier GPU. In some cases (e.g. PUBG<br>
      or Overwatch) gamers will see fewer frame drops by disabling the E<br>
      Cores all together. If recent history is a guide, stock levels at MSRP are<br>
      likely to deplete rapidly.<br>
